## Code Editor

1. Code Editor Windows Application (WinForms or WPF)
2. Code Editor Node.js Desktop Application
  * This can help. http://electron.atom.io/
  * Possibly use Canvas and WebGL.
3. Enhanced graphics effects related to code/text. :zap:
  * There should be small animations with font/text on things like copy/paste and delete.
  * Small effects related to sytanx errors
  * Some visualization of code execution
